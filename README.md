# Vivliorgano
Vivliorgano is a physical library manager for keeping track of books,
games, music, and other physical media.

Vivliorgano exposes a REST endpoint which would allow the user to add or remove media to the manager remotely, for example via a mobile app.

### Etymology
Vivliorgano comes from the Greek "οργανωτής βιβλίων", or "organotís vivlíon"; which means "book organiser".
